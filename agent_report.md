# Agent Controller Report

**Milestone 6 — Part 2 | MLOps Course**

**Model:** mistral:7b-instruct (via Ollama)  
**Tools:** Retriever · Summarizer · Extractor  
**Evaluation:** 10 multi-step tasks  
**Hardware:** Apple M2 Pro, 16 GB RAM

> **Note:** All results in this report were produced by running `python agent_controller.py` end-to-end with real Ollama LLM calls. Traces are saved to `agent_traces/task_01.json` – `task_10.json`.

## 1. Tool Selection Policy

### 1.1 Available Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Trigger Condition |
|------|---------|------------------|
| **Retriever** | Fetches top-k relevant chunks from FAISS index | Query requires factual grounding or external knowledge |
| **Summarizer** | Condenses retrieved text into concise key points | Retrieved context is long (>300 words) or task asks for summary |
| **Extractor** | Pulls structured facts/lists from retrieved text | Task asks to "list", "extract", "compare", or "enumerate" |

### 1.2 Planning Phase

The agent uses the LLM in a **planning loop** before execution. The model receives a tool registry and task description, then returns a JSON array of ordered steps:

```
Input:  task description + tool descriptions
Output: [{"tool": "retriever", "reason": "..."}, {"tool": "extractor", "reason": "..."}]
```

This makes decision logic observable and auditable. If the LLM output is malformed JSON, the agent falls back to the default plan: `[retriever → summarizer]`.

### 1.3 Decision Rules (observed from real evaluation)

1. **Retriever always runs first** — selected in all 10 tasks.
2. **Extractor** was selected in all 10 tasks — mistral:7b-instruct consistently chose extraction for structured retrieval tasks.
3. **Summarizer** was not selected by the planner in any task during this run (the LLM preferred extractor for all task types).
4. **Final answer generation** always runs last, synthesising accumulated context.
5. **Unknown tool handling** — in task_09, the planner returned a tool named `"none"` which was gracefully skipped with a WARNING log; task still succeeded.

### 1.4 Retrieval Integration

The retriever tool reuses the FAISS index and embedding model built in Part 1 — no code duplication. Its output is a structured dict:

```json
{
  "tool": "retriever",
  "results": [{"doc_title": "...", "text": "...", "relevance_score": 0.71}],
  "latency_ms": 533.0
}
```

Retrieved texts are accumulated in `retrieved_texts[]` and passed to downstream tools. The agent explicitly logs which documents were retrieved and their relevance scores at each step.

## 2. Retrieval Integration Architecture

```
Task → [PLANNER (LLM)] → Step Plan
                              │
              ┌───────────────┼───────────────────┐
              ▼               ▼                   ▼
         RETRIEVER       SUMMARIZER           EXTRACTOR
              │               │                   │
              └───────────────┴───────────────────┘
                              │ accumulated_context
                              ▼
                    FINAL ANSWER GENERATOR (LLM)
                              │
                              ▼
                     Answer + Trace saved to agent_traces/
```

The retriever is always the **primary knowledge source**. Summarizer and Extractor are **transformation tools** that restructure retrieved content for the final answer.

## 3. Performance Analysis — 10 Tasks (Real Run)

| Task ID | Task Description | Tools Used | Steps | Success | Total Time (s) | Notes |
|---------|-----------------|-----------|-------|---------|----------------|-------|
| task_01 | RAG system benefits | R → E → Gen | 4 | ✓ | 67.8 | Fully grounded |
| task_02 | Vector database characteristics | R → E → Gen | 4 | ✓ | 46.3 | Clean extraction |
| task_03 | Local LLM deployment options | R → E → Gen | 4 | ✓ | 61.0 | Accurate serving info |
| task_04 | RAG evaluation metrics | R → E → Gen | 4 | ✓ | 112.7 | Slow planning (65s) |
| task_05 | Chunking strategy comparison | R → E → Gen | 4 | ✓ | 79.1 | Good tradeoff analysis |

**Success rate: 10/10 full successes, 0 failures**

> R = Retriever, E = Extractor, Gen = Final Answer Generator

### 3.1 Task Diversity Coverage

| Scenario Type | Tasks | Coverage |
|---------------|-------|----------|
| Factual retrieval | task_01, task_02, task_04 | ✓ |
| Procedural / how-to | task_03, task_08 | ✓ |
| Design / trade-off | task_05, task_06 | ✓ |
| Conceptual explanation | task_09, task_10 | ✓ |
| Multi-topic synthesis | task_07 | ✓ |

### 3.2 Tool Selection Distribution (Real)

| Tool | Times Selected | % of Tool Steps |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Retriever | 10 | 50% |
| Extractor | 10 | 50% |
| Summarizer | 0 | 0% |
| (none — skipped) | 1 | — |

The LLM planner consistently chose `[retriever → extractor]` for all tasks. Summarizer was not selected — likely because the model interpreted all tasks as requiring structured extraction rather than prose summarization.

## 4. Failure Analysis and Observed Behaviors

Although the agent achieved a 10/10 success rate, several tasks exposed weaknesses and edge cases that would cause failures at scale or with harder queries. These are documented below.

### 4.1 Task 04 — Slow Extractor and Generation Latency

**Observation:** task_04 total time was 112.7s — the longest among typical tasks (excluding task_10).

**Root cause:** The planning step for task_04 was actually the fastest of all 10 tasks (4.4s). The slowness came from two other steps: the extractor took 41.7s (highest extractor latency of any task) and the final answer generation took 64.5s (highest generation latency among tasks 1–9). Both steps were slower because the RAG evaluation metrics task required the LLM to define and explain multiple metrics (Precision@k, Recall@k, MRR, nDCG) in detail, producing a longer-than-average output.

**Impact:** No quality degradation — the extracted metrics were correct and well-structured.

### 4.2 Task 09 — Unexpected Tool Name

**Observation:** The planner returned a tool called `"none"` (in addition to `retriever` and `extractor`). The controller logged a WARNING: `Unknown tool 'none', skipping.`

**Root cause:** The LLM produced a 3-tool plan including a null/placeholder tool name. This is a known issue with instruction-following models producing JSON with unexpected values.

**Impact:** None — the fallback `skip` behavior worked correctly, and the task completed successfully with the retriever and extractor outputs.

**Proposed fix:** Add a JSON schema validator on the planning output to filter unknown tool names before execution.

### 4.3 Task 10 — Extreme Final Answer Latency

**Observation:** task_10 total time was 609.1s (~10 minutes), of which ~570s was the final answer generation step.

**Root cause:** The chain-of-thought prompting task produced a very long final answer listing all prompting techniques in detail. The mistral:7b-instruct model generated an unusually long token sequence (~15 tokens/s × ~8,500 tokens ≈ 570s). The model was not given a max-tokens constraint.

**Proposed fix:** Add `max_tokens=512` or `max_tokens=800` to the final answer generation call to cap generation time.

### 4.4 Planner Always Chose Extractor

**Observation:** The LLM planner selected `extractor` for all 10 tasks, even for tasks like task_01 ("summarize the key benefits") and task_09 ("explain how...") where `summarizer` might have been more appropriate.

**Analysis:** The mistral:7b-instruct model appears to prefer the extractor tool when it identifies a list or enumeration in the task description. For task_01 ("key benefits"), the word "benefits" implies a list. This is a model-level behavior, not a planning framework bug.

**Impact:** Minimal — extracted bullet lists are also useful for final answer generation, and all answers were coherent and grounded.

### 4.5 Failure Modes Summary

| Failure Type | Observed? | Tasks Affected | Severity |
|-------------|-----------|---------------|----------|
| Wrong tool selected | Partial | All 10 — summarizer never chosen even when appropriate (task_01, task_09) | Low — extractor output still usable |
| Unknown tool from planner | Yes | task_09 — `"none"` returned | Low — gracefully skipped |
| Runaway generation (no max_tokens) | Yes | task_10 — 570s for one answer | Medium — would cause timeout in production |
| Retrieval returns irrelevant docs | Not observed | — | — |
| Agent gives up / refuses to answer | Not observed | — | — |
| JSON parse failure in planner | Not observed (fallback exists) | — | — |

**When would this agent fail?** The biggest risk is out-of-domain queries where the FAISS index returns low-confidence results (similar to Q9 in Part 1, where all scores were < 0.12). The agent currently has no confidence threshold — it would still attempt extraction and generation on irrelevant chunks, producing hallucinated answers. Adding a minimum similarity score cutoff (e.g., 0.20) would mitigate this.

## 5. Model Quality and Latency Tradeoffs

### 5.1 mistral:7b-instruct Performance

| Aspect | Observation |
|--------|-------------|
| Instruction following | Strong — correctly follows "answer from context" in all 10 tasks |
| Tool plan quality | Good — produced valid JSON plan in 9/10 tries; 1 had unknown tool name |
| Grounding discipline | Good — all answers grounded in retrieved context |
| Extraction quality | High — numbered lists were well-structured in all tasks |
| Latency consistency | Inconsistent — task_10 final answer took 570s vs. typical 30-40s |

### 5.2 Latency Profile (Real)

| Step | Min | Mean (tasks 1-9) | Max (all tasks) | Notes |
|------|-----|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| Planning (LLM) | 4s | ~8s | 12s (task_05) | task_04 had fastest planning at 4.4s |
| Retrieval (embedding + FAISS) | 0.5s | ~2.4s | 4.1s (task_05) | CPU-bound embedding; varies per run |
| Extractor (LLM) | 17s | ~29s | 42s (task_04) | Depends on response length |
| Final generation (LLM) | 17s | ~33s | 570s (task_10) | task_04 highest non-outlier at 64.5s |
| **3-step task total** | **46s** | **~70s** | **113s** | Typical range |

### 5.3 Tradeoffs Observed

**Quality vs. Latency:** task_10's 570s final generation produced a comprehensive answer listing all prompting techniques — high quality but impractically slow. Constraining `max_tokens` would reduce latency without major quality loss.

**Model size:** A 7B model provides strong instruction-following for RAG tasks. For the planning step, a smaller 3B model (e.g., `mistral:3b`) could reduce planning latency by ~60% with acceptable plan quality.

**Quantisation:** Ollama uses 4-bit quantisation by default. This reduces quality slightly but is necessary for local inference on consumer hardware. A full-precision model on a GPU server would yield better latency consistency.

## 6. Conclusion

The multi-tool agent successfully completed **10/10 tasks** with fully grounded, multi-step answers. Key findings from the real run:

1. **Perfect success rate:** All tasks completed with `success=true`.
2. **Consistent tool selection:** Planner chose `[retriever → extractor → generator]` for all tasks.
3. **Outlier latency:** task_10's final generation took ~570s (chain-of-thought listing was extremely long) — a max-tokens cap is recommended.
4. **Graceful error handling:** The unknown `"none"` tool in task_09 was skipped without failure.
5. **No retrieval failures:** All tasks retrieved relevant documents from the FAISS index.

**Top improvements:**
1. Add `max_tokens=512` to final answer generation to prevent runaway generation (task_10 case).
2. Add a JSON schema validator for planning output to filter unknown tool names.
3. Use GPU-accelerated embedding to reduce retrieval latency from ~1s to ~10ms.
