            "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is an AI framework that enhances large language models "
            "by dynamically retrieving relevant information from an external knowledge base at inference time. "
            "Unlike purely parametric models that rely solely on information encoded during training, RAG systems "
            "combine neural retrieval with language model generation to produce responses grounded in factual, "
            "verifiable sources.\n\n"
            "The RAG pipeline operates in four main stages. First, documents are ingested and split into smaller "
            "chunks using a chunking strategy. Second, each chunk is encoded into a dense embedding vector. Third, "
            "when a user query arrives, it is also embedded and the most relevant chunks are retrieved via vector "
            "similarity search. Fourth, the retrieved chunks are concatenated with the query, and the language model "
            "generates a grounded answer.\n\n"
            "Benefits of RAG include reduced hallucination because responses are grounded in retrieved evidence, "
            "knowledge currency since retrieval corpora can be updated without retraining, source attribution for "
            "verifiable outputs, and cost efficiency since knowledge updates require only corpus changes. RAG is widely "
            "used for question answering over private documents, technical support, and knowledge-intensive NLP tasks.\n\n"
            "Common failure modes include retrieval failures when relevant documents are not retrieved, context window "
            "overflow with too many chunks, and generation errors where the LLM ignores retrieved context. Proper "

        "content": (
            "Chunking is one of the most important design decisions in a RAG pipeline. The chunk size and overlap "
            "strategy directly affect retrieval quality by determining what information is co-located in a single "
            "retrievable unit.\n\n"
            "Fixed-size character chunking splits text into segments of a specified character count with optional overlap "
            "between adjacent chunks. This approach is simple to implement and provides consistent chunk sizes. The overlap "
            "prevents important information from being split at chunk boundaries. Typical parameters are 256-1024 characters "
            "with 10-20% overlap. Smaller chunks improve retrieval precision but may lack sufficient context for generation.\n\n"
            "Recursive character text splitting attempts to split on semantic boundaries (paragraphs, then sentences, then "
            "words) before falling back to character splits. This preserves natural text structure better than pure "
            "character splitting.\n\n"
            "Semantic chunking uses embedding similarity to identify natural topic boundaries, grouping sentences that are "
            "semantically related. This produces variable-size chunks that better capture complete thoughts but is "
            "computationally expensive.\n\n"
            "For technical documents, fixed-size chunking with 512 characters and 100-character overlap provides a good "
            "balance: chunks are large enough to contain meaningful information, small enough for precise retrieval, and "
            "the overlap handles boundary cases. Token-based chunking using model tokenizers is more precise but requires "
